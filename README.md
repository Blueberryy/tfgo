# Team Fortress: Global Offensive Arena [![Action Status](https://github.com/Mikusch/tfgo/workflows/Package/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mikusch/tfgo/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
TF:GO Arena brings the bomb defusal mode from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to Team Fortress 2.
All players begin the game with basic weapons and can buy new equipment at the start of each round with money earned from neutralizing enemy players or planting the bomb.

## Compatible Maps
Any arena map should be compatible with this gamemode, as long as it doesn't do weird stuff.
A `func_respawnroom` entity for each team to define the buy zones is highly recommended but not required.
